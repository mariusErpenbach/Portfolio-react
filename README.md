This is my personal Portfolio.

It's an two day project.

I mostly work with react js and scss.

The first hours I take to plan my concept.

- simple designed "cube" who can be turned by the user. 
input method should be the arrow keys (for right hand) or keypress "W","A","S","D" (for left hand).

 each side of the cube should hold 1 actual __page__ .

a __page__ will be a component which holds the html elements.

each page should be 95% width and 95% height of the viewers display.
